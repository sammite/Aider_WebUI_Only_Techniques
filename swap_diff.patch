 Just my personal mods to the docker version of aider
 
+This project is designed for users who have access to much more powerful models via a web interface (like Gemini) than via API, but who still want to utilize the CLI workflow of aider.
+
+My Dockerfile enhancements allow running aider in a container specifically for **copy-paste mode**, as first-party support for this workflow within Docker seems to be missing.
+
+*Tested on Ubuntu 22.04.*
